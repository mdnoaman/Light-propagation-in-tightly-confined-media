# Light-propagation-in-tightly-confined-atomic-media
Propagation of light through a medium is mainly chracterized by the succeptibility of the medium. The complex nature of succeptibility gives rise to both, absoprtion and dispersion.
Dispersion is responsible for bending of light while absorption causes loss of intensity as the beam propagates inside.
In this page, a special example is considered where a laser beam passes through a cloud of atoms tightly confined in one dimension.
Such system is readily produced with laser cooling and trapping techniques. These atoms generally are Alkali and Alkali earth metal atoms.
The interesting features these atoms are they show resonances in visible optical wavelengths.
Near the resonance, the succeptibility is very strongly modified. Which in return, modifies the beam propagation inside such cloud very close to the resonance.
The linewidth of such resonances are several MHz making it interesting for extremely sensitive measurements and controls.

In this article, a model is described to solve the Helmholtz equation to numerically simulate the beam propagation inside such a cloud.
The main idea relies on split-step method using FFT and IFFT in python.

some of the typical results are shown in the attached images.
